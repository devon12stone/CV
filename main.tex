\cvevent{Data Scientist}{One Finance & Investment Limited}{Apr 2018 -- June 2019}{London, United Kingdom}
One Finance is a finance start-up that specialises in short term lending. During my time at One Finance, I was exposed to the entire end to end process of Data Science including SQL, MongoDB, Python, Neo4j, Django, and Flask. I was fortunate enough to be a part of developing the company's loan repayment and client income prediction models, which were developed using Keras and Scikit-Learn Developing. However, the most rewarding project I worked on during my time at the company was creating and managing their data science internship program.
